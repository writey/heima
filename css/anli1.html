  <h1>Quiz: Have you been getting these lyrics wrong all this time?</h1>
<p id="source">By Fraser McAlpine</p>

<p id="date">Friday 6th July 2018</p>

<p>When you're singing along with an iconic song, fluffing the lyrics can be a disorienting experience, but it's very common. In fact the word mondegreen specifically refers to lyrics that people commonly mishear - from "she's got a chicken to ride" to "hold me closer, Tony Danza".</p>

<p>With that in mind, can you name the correct versions of these frequently (and comically) misheard lyrics?</p>
